CSEdIRB
=======
The purpose of this repository is to provide a quick-start guide for Computer
Scientists who are branching out into the field of CS Education research. One
common challenge for researchers with no social science background is learning
how and why to work with your Institutional Review Board (IRB). This repository
provides sample resources that can be used as guides for working toward IRB
approval.

**IMPORTANT**: Ultimately, the IRB at *your* institution has authority over your
research. As such, the resources provided here are only samples that can be
used to get started. We cannot guarantee that your project will be approved,
even if you copy these protocols verbatim. Different IRBs adopt different
interpretations of the relevant laws, and they are free to impose more
stringent requirements as appropriate. Consequently, it is your responsibility
to work with your own IRB and to make yourself aware of the policies and
interpretations they enforce.

## Sections and documents:

  * Just the Basics - This document provides basic definitions and summaries
    of the relevant history and legislation relating to the ethical treatment
    of human subject in research. This guide is not intended as a replacement
    for the [CITI Program](https://www.citiprogram.org/) or any other training
    your institution may require, instead acting like a Cliff's Notes summary.

  * Advice and Best Practices - This directory contains statements from
    experienced CS Education researchers who have volunteered to share their
    perspectives on how to work successfully with your IRB.

  * Common Mistakes and Obstacles - Most of us, at some point, have an IRB
    encounter that does not go as smoothly as planned. These situations can
    arise from communication failures, unanticipated obstacles, or legitimate
    concerns regarding the protection of subjects. These documents identify
    common problems and offer advice on how to work with your IRB to address
    them.

  * Sample Protocols - This directory contains sample protocols for a number of
    different types of projects. These protocols may provide insight in how you
    can describe your own work in a way that prevents unnecessary difficulty
    with approval.

  * Social Science Research Methods for Techies - Many (most?) in the CS
    community have no training or experience doing social science research.
    These documents provide a basic overview of the ideas and techniques used
    in social science research and can serve as a quick primer.
